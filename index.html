                I would like to say here that I have joined easyenglishwithvini course for few days. So far I have had a
                very good experience. Before this I had joined another online English course. Different from that, the
                lessons are arranged in a way that everyone can understand very well. Thank you very much ma'am.<em>Everyone
                can join this with confidence.100% Guaranteed.</em>

                This online class of yours is very helpful. I have been living in the English Country for a year. But it
                was very difficult for me to speak. I started with your level 1. Now I can say small sentences without
                fear. I used to be able to speak a little before this class, but the fear of being wrong made me very
                anxious. <em>But after completing level 1 of your online class, many of my doubts were cleared. Now I
                want to do level 2.</em> This class will be very beneficial for everyone who wants to learn English.

                My name is Praveen Paul. I am working as a manager in a private company. I loved the English language
                even when I was in school. But I found very difficult to speak. The main reason for this is that there
                is no opportunity to speak. Another reason is that i should not have known how to say many things in
                English. I used to watch many youtube channels to solve my problem. But when I started watching this
                channel I liked it a lot. This channel explains things in a very simple and beautiful way. It is
                explained in a way that any common man can understand. And from here I could learn how to say simple
                things in English that are needed in normal life. Started practicing speaking with it. So I was able to
                improvise a lot. <em>This course is designed in a very useful manner. I was also able to learn grammar
                and many very useful things in English</em>. Vini Mam's this course and youtube channel have helped me a
                lot. Thank you very much Vini mam for your effort. May God bless you abundantly.

                Enrolling for Vini‚Äôs Spoken English classes was <em>one of the best decisions that I made</em>. Before,
                I did not have the confidence to speak in English. I could not even understand children's books. Now, I
                am able to read and understand children's novels. I can form small sentences on my own. I even
                understand Grammar much better now. Vini's classes are <strong>very organized</strong>. She covers basic
                topics with a lot of examples and practice questions. She is such a good teacher. She is like a friend.

                I appreciate Vini's efforts and the structure she has created for easy learning. It's great that she
                presented the same examples for all tenses, which made it easier to understand and revise the lessons.
                The live sessions have been helpful in correcting mistakes and providing a platform to apply what we've
                learned. The quizzes after each section are also a valuable exercise for revising the sessions. Overall,
                it is <em> a well-designed learning experience.</em>

                I used to get very nervous when I had to speak in English. I joined this course to overcome my fear of
                speaking English. I started studying systematically according to Vini mam's instructions. She pointed
                out some mistakes I was making while speaking and corrected them. <em>She cleared all my doubts at the
                earliest.</em> Slowly I got out of my comfort zone and started speaking English with confidence. I'm
                very happy to have such a sincere trainer like her.

                <em>It was a simple and effective explanation of all the necessary grammar we need in day to day

                Learning those lessons repeatedly and thoroughly as well as practising in a consistent way can surely
                elevate one's English levels.
                Our live sessions were so interesting that sometimes I felt like 1hr passed like 10 mins and wished if
                it would last a little longer..
                Your course material is very useful, content oriented and simple.
