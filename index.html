      <div class="text">This online class of yours is very helpful. I have been living in the English Country for a year. But it was very difficult for me to speak. I started with your level 1. Now I can say small sentences without fear. I used to be able to speak a little before this class, but the fear of being wrong made me very anxious. <em>But after completing level 1 of your online class, many of my doubts were cleared. Now I want to do level 2.</em> This class will be very beneficial for everyone who wants to learn English.

      <div class="text">My name is Praveen Paul. I am working as a manager in a private company. I loved the English language even when I was in school. But I found very difficult to speak. The main reason for this is that there is no opportunity to speak. Another reason is that i should not have known how to say many things in English. I used to watch many youtube channels to solve my problem. But when I started watching this channel I liked it a lot. This channel explains things in a very simple and beautiful way. It is explained in a way that any common man can understand. And from here I could learn how to say simple things in English that are needed in normal life. Started practicing speaking with it. So I was able to improvise a lot. <em>This course is designed in a very useful manner. I was also able to learn grammar and many very useful things in English</em>. Vini Mam's this course and youtube channel have helped me a lot. Thank you very much Vini mam for your effort. May God bless you abundantly. <br/><br/> Praveen</div>

      <div class="text">Enrolling for Vini‚Äôs Spoken English classes was <em>one of the best decisions that I made</em>. Before, I did not have the confidence to speak in English. I could not even understand children's books. Now, I am able to read and understand children's novels. I can form small sentences on my own. I even understand Grammar much better now. Vini's classes are <strong>very organized</strong>. She covers basic topics with a lot of examples and practice questions. She is such a good teacher. She is like a friend. <br/><br/> Riyana</div>

      <div class="text">I appreciate Vini's efforts and the structure she has created for easy learning. It's great that she presented the same examples for all tenses, which made it easier to understand and revise the lessons. The live sessions  have been helpful in correcting mistakes and providing a platform to apply what we've learned. The quizzes after each section are also a valuable exercise for revising the sessions. Overall, it is <em> a well-designed learning experience.</em> <br/><br/> Vineesh</div>

      <div class="text">I used to get very nervous when I had to speak in English. I joined this course to overcome my fear of speaking English. I started studying systematically according to Vini mam's instructions. She pointed out some mistakes I was making while speaking and corrected them. <em>She cleared all my doubts at the earliest.</em> Slowly I got out of my comfort zone and started speaking English with confidence. I'm very happy to have such a sincere trainer like her. <br/><br/> Lakshmi</div>

      <div class="text">This course covers all the areas necessary for speaking English confidently.Vini has explained all the sections in an easily understandable manner and it was never boring.
        This course was definitely an eye opener for me as it helped to clarify all my doubts and misunderstandings
        about using this language.<em>I feel relieved from all the confusions I had about framing sentences.
          Thank you Vini for all your efforts & hard work, for being an amazing tutor and for your patience and compassion.</em> May God bless you..!!<br/><br/> Mariyam</div>

      <div class="text">Thank you so much for this wonderful course.
        <em>It was a simple and effective explanation of all the necessary grammar we need in day to day conversations..</em>
        Learning those lessons repeatedly and thoroughly as well as practising in a consistent way can surely elevate one's English levels.
        Our live sessions were so interesting that sometimes I felt like 1hr passed like 10 mins and wished if it would last a little longer..
        Your course material is very useful, content oriented and simple.
        Thank you once again for your sincere and dedicated effort to make the English learning easier.<br/><br/> Leeba</div>
